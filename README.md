# Honeypot Blocklists from Sequoia Heights MS

## Overview

This repository offers an integrated solution featuring a probe and client. Our blocklists, sourced from our honeypot network, are freely available. We provide a sync client for up-to-date protection and a probe tool for contributing new data. The blocklist contains IP addresses that have attempted unauthorized access on a honeypot probe, serving as a valuable resource for enhancing network security.

## Features

- Regularly updated list of malicious IP addresses.
- Easy integration with various firewalls and security systems.
- Helps prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

## Products

This repository offers two separate products:

1. **Honeypot Blocklist Probe**: Collects IPs from Fail2ban and uploads them to GitHub.
2. **Honeypot Blocklist Client**: Syncs IPs from GitHub and applies them to Firewalld.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `gcc`
- `systemd`
- `fail2ban` (for the probe)
- `firewalld` (for the client)
- `logrotate`

### Installing from RPMs (x86_64)

1. **Download the RPM files**

   Download the latest RPMs for the probe and client from the [releases page](https://github.com/sequoiaheightsms/honeypot-blocklist/releases).

2. **Install the Probe**

   ```bash
   sudo yum install honeypot-blocklist-probe-<version>.el9.x86_64.rpm
   ```

3. **Install the Client**

   ```bash
   sudo yum install honeypot-blocklist-client-<version>.el9.x86_64.rpm
   ```

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sequoiaheightsms/honeypot-blocklist.git
```

## Configuration

### Honeypot Blocklist Probe

The probe syncs fail2ban and applies new IPs to the Unauthorized Access Blocklist in GitHub.

A helper script called setup.sh 

```bash
./setup.sh --probe
```

it will help generate an SSH key pair (if it doesn't already exist) for secure communication with GitHub. The key will be labeled as `id_rsa_probe`. If the key exists, it will not generate a new one.

also it will install and configure Fail2ban by creating `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`:

```ini
[sshd]
enabled  = true
port     = ssh
logpath  = %(sshd_log)s
backend  = %(sshd_backend)s
maxretry = 2
bantime  = 6h
```
and perform the installation of the RPMs and start and enable the services.

### Honeypot Blocklist Client

The client syncs the blocklist from GitHub and applies the IPs to Firewalld. The helper script can be used for installation and setup.

```bash
./setup.sh --client
```

## Logging

Both the probe and client log their activities to:

- Probe: `/var/log/honeypot-probe.log`
- Client: `/var/log/honeypot-client.log`

Log rotation is handled by `logrotate` with the following configurations:

- Probe: `/etc/logrotate.d/honeypot-probe`
- Client: `/etc/logrotate.d/honeypot-client`
